# Neuralm-Server

The neuralm server creates and manages the neural networks in the neuralm project.

These neural networks are created and mutated on the server and then distributed to the client. This way, we can combine the processing power of multiple computers and run numerous training sessions at the same time.
This is needed to reduce the overall training time.
